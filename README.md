Four-Stroke Engine Simulation
This project demonstrates the working mechanism of a four-stroke internal combustion engine using 3D modeling and animation. It visually represents all four strokes: intake, compression, power, and exhaust.

Features
3D model of a four-stroke engine

Animation of piston movement

Visual representation of valve operation

Step-by-step demonstration of all four strokes

Strokes Illustrated
Intake Stroke
The intake valve opens and the piston moves downward, drawing the air-fuel mixture into the cylinder.

Compression Stroke
Both valves are closed. The piston moves upward, compressing the air-fuel mixture.

Power Stroke
A spark ignites the compressed mixture, forcing the piston downward.

Exhaust Stroke
The exhaust valve opens and the piston moves upward again, pushing out the burnt gases.

Tools and Software Used
SolidWorks for 3D modeling

Blender/KeyShot for animation and rendering (if applicable)

Git for version control

Installation and Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/hrishiraj12/four-stroke-engine.git

Open the project files in SolidWorks or your preferred 3D CAD software.

Run the animation or simulation to visualize the engine cycle.
